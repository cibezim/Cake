Chapter 3 & 4 Notes

Variables come in two flavors: primitive and reference.

Primitives include integers, booleans, and floating-point numbers.

Variables must have a type (e.g., int, String) and a name.

Reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as variable names.

Objects have state (represented by instance variables) and behavior (methods).

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.It describes how objects of that type should be made.

Methods can receive values (arguments) from the caller using parameters.

Methods can return values using the return statement.

Methods with a void return type do not return values.

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
